Advertisement Recommendation Model In R
Research Questions
Create a prediction model that more accurately predicts whether a user will click an Ad or not.

Problem Statement
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process which would be used for anlaysis.

Context
We have 1000 rows

We have the following columns:

'Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site'

'Age'

'Area.Income'

'Daily.Internet.Usage'

'Ad.Topic.Line'

'City'

'Male'

'Country'

'Timestamp'

'Clicked.on.Ad'

Steps Followed

Step 1.Loading Data
  Using tidyverse library

Step 2.Data Exploration/Cleaning
Renamed the columns
There were no missing values and duplicates
The few outliers that were avilable I did not remove them so that we can identify the reasons as to why they exist and at times there are of importance

Step 3.Model Training
I used KNeighbours Classifier to fit the model

Step 4.Model Prediction
using the split data to make prediction
